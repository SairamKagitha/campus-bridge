## Problem Statement / Use Case
“Campus Bridge – Integrated Academic LMS + Coding Skill Development Platform”

## Abstract / Problem Description
Campus Bridge is a unified web platform designed to streamline both academic management and coding skill development for university students. It serves as an all-in-one solution for accessing course content, managing attendance, completing assignments, and tracking academic progress, while also providing structured coding paths and a built-in compiler to help students improve their programming skills. The platform includes interfaces for students, faculty, and administrators to ensure a seamless academic and technical learning experience. Campus Bridge aims to bridge the gap between college education and industry readiness by fostering continuous learning, coding practice, and progress tracking.

## Tech Stack Used
- **Frontend:** Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript
- **Backend:** Next.js API Routes
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** Prisma
- **Authentication:** NextAuth.js
- **Compiler Integration:** Judge0 API
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Project Explanation

Campus Bridge includes the following core modules:

### 🔹 Student Interface
- View and manage academic content: lecture slides, videos, notes
- Track attendance and assignment submissions
- Enroll in structured coding tracks (e.g., DSA, Python, Web Development)

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
